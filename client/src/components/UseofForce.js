      <h1 className="body"><i>UNLAWFUL</i> ACTIONS BY AN <b>OFFICER</b></h1>
<p>This subject in particular is <b>very</b> close and personal to <b>good officers</b>.</p>
<i>NOTHING</i> angers an officer more than <b>another officer</b> <i>ABUSING</i> their <b>authority</b>.
<p>Many officers deal with issues caused by another officer, such as <i>racism</i>, <i>sexism</i>, and <i>excessive force</i>.</p>
<p>"I don't want to be another Rodney King." "I know how the police are these days." "I watch the news. Y'all will shoot anyone!"</p>
<h3>But officers are above the law!</h3>
<p>Except they <b>ARE NOT</b>. If a department is <i>corrupt</i>, the state's <b>BUREAU OF INVESTIGATION</b> will step in and do an <i>investigation</i>.</p>
<p>The department I worked for wouldn't wait for the <b>GBI</b> to get involved. We were always the <i>FIRST</i> ones going after corrupt officers in our department.</p>
<p>Any officer that is okay with <i>corrpution</i> <b>SHOULD NOT</b> be an officer.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, <b>rural and smaller</b> departments do not receive the <b>funding or training</b> to create a <i>strong, better</i> police force.</p>
<p><b>Large</b> departments have the opposite issue; they have the funding and training, but have a <i>larger head count</i> which creates more room for <i>issues</i>.</p>
<p>For example, my department had approximately <b>670 officers</b>, whereas the city I lived in had <b>45 officers</b>.</p>
<p>My department has a higher chance for a single officer to become <i>corrupt</i>, but we had more <b>funding and training</b> to offset these challenges.</p>
<h3>What is considered an illegal action by an officer?</h3>
<p>Most things an officer does is <i>illegal</i> for a citizen to do. Officers are <b>granted the authority</b> to act outside the law <b>SO LONG AS</b>
the <i>risk</i> to the <b>public</b> does not <i>outweigh</i> the <b>potential outcome</b>.</p>
<p>If an officer is <b>pursuing</b> a criminal in a veicle, but the criminal is <i>driving irratically</i>, the officer will <b>call off the chase</b>
to avoid <i>risking the safety</i> of the public.</p>
<p>When an officer <b>knowingly or blatantly</b> <i>breaks the law</i>, he will be tried in court.</p>
<h3>But what about you?</h3>
<p>The <b>most common</b> <i>illegal actions</i> an officer takes <i>against</i> a citizen are <b>illegal searching, wrongful arrests, and excessive force</b>.</p>
<ul>
  <li><b>Illegal Searching:</b> When an officer does <i>NOT</i> have <b>probable cause</b> to do a fully invasive search, but still does.</li>
  <li><b>Wrongful Arrests:</b> When an officer arrests an individual without the <b>probable cause</b> necessary to justify an arrest.</li>
  <li><b>Excessive ForceL</b> When an officer uses a level of force longer than necessary, or uses a higher level of force than is necessary.</li>
  <li><b>Probably Cause:</b> With all available information, it is believed a <i>crime</i> was committed,
    certain <b>property</b> was involved, and certain <b>people</b> committed the crime.</li>
</ul>
<h2><b>Use of Force</b></h2>
<ul>
  <li>Level 1: Officer Presenece</li>
  <li>Level 2: Verbal Commands</li>
  <li>Level 3: Soft Hand Tactics</li>
  <li>Level 4: Tazer and OC Spray</li>
  <li>Level 5: Hard Hand Tactics</li>
  <li>Level 6: Less-than-Lethal Force (Bean Bag Rounds, Baton)</li>
  <li>Level 7: Lethal Force (Firearms)</li>
</ul>
<p>Why do you need to know about use of force?</p>
<p>Officers are authorized by law to user <b>one level of force </b><i>HIGHER</i> than the individual they are trying to <b>gain compliance</b> from.</p>
<p>If you <i>swing</i> at an officer, the law has determined they are <b>justified</b> to use a <b>baton</b> against you until you <b>comply</b>.</p>
<p>There is a <b>reasonable standard</b> for use of force, which states if an officer uses <i>one use of force</i> continously without
  <b>attempting another level of force</b> to gain compliance, they are using <b>Excessive Force</b>.</p>
  <p>It also states if an officer uses <i>MORE THAN ONE LEVEL HIGHER</i> than the suspect it is <i>excessive</i>.</p>
  <h3>If you believe an officer has committed a crime against you...</h3>
  <p><b>Get a lawyer</b> as soon as possible. <i>DO NOT CONFRONT THE OFFICER</i>. <b>ALWAYS</b> get a lawyer and <b>take it to court</b>.</p>
