      <div>
      <h3 className="body">An officer walks up to you and asks to talk.</h3>
<h3>You keep hearing the <b>detained</b> word throw around.</h3>
<h3>What does <b>detained</b> even mean?</h3>
<p><b>DETAINED:</b> during an <i>investigation</i>, an officer may keep you in their <i>custody</i> until they are certain <b>you</b> have not committed a crime.</p>
  <p>Until the <b>officer</b> states you may <i>leave,</i> or are <i>free to go</i>, it is best to assume you are still <b>detained</b>.</p>
    <h3>How do I know if I am <b>detained</b>?</h3>
    <p>Apart from asking the <b>officer</b>, you may use context clues to determine if you are <i>free to leave</i>.</p>
    <p>For instance, if an officer has pulled you over for a <b>Traffic Stop</b>, you are <b>detained</b>.</p>
    <p>In most jurisdictions, an officer <i>MUST</i> have their emergency vehicle lights active during a <b>Traffic Stop</b> in order to detain you.</p>
    <h3>That's simple, but what about if it isn't a traffic stop?</h3>
    <p>Sometimes, it is best to <b>politely ask</b> the officer if you are free to leave.</p>
    <p>Instead of asking, <i>"Am I being detained?"</i>, try asking, <b>"Am I free to leave, or do you need me to stay?"</b></p>
    <p>What you ask is less important than how you ask it.</p>
    <p>Also, always remember being a <b>VICTIM</b> of a crime means you are <b>INVOLVED</b> in the crime. Yes, as a victim, <b>you are detained.</b></p>
    <h3>Okay, but I didn't commit a crime!</h3>
    <p>The officer likely knows something you <b>don't know</b>.</p>
    <p>A simple example is a crime was committed in the area and you fit the description of the perpetrator.</p>
    <p>The more willing you are to comply with the officer, the faster the officer can check your story and release you.</p>
    <h3>Ask questions, but be respectful of the officer's time.</h3>
    <p>The more respectful you are to the officer, the more willing the officer will be to answer all your questions.</p>
    <h3>The officer said I was <b>FREE TO LEAVE</b> but is in my way or grabbed me.</h3>
    <p>This is <i>illegal</i> and will be covered under <b>UNLAWFUL ACTIONS BY AN OFFICER</b>.</p>

    <h1>REMEMBER:</h1>
    <p>To detain, an officer must have reasonable suspicion that a crime was committed and you were involved.</p>
    <p>They do not have to tell you their reason, but do have to tell you if you are detained.</p>
    <p>If you feel your rights have been violated, get a copy of the police report at your local police station and contact a lawyer.</p>

    <h1>"I am going to <b>detain you</b> <i>in handcuffs.</i>"</h1>
<h3>Hold the @$#%ing phone. Did that <b>OFFICER</b> just say he is <i>ARRESTING</i> me?!</h3>
<p>In short, no. The officer is still <b>DETAINING</b> you, which I covered under the <b>DETAINED</b> page.</p>
<p>Being detained means you are involved in an investigation of a possible crime, whether that is...</p>
<ul>
  <li>Traffic Violation</li>
  <li>Domestic Situation</li>
  <li>911 Phone Call</li>
  <li>Victim of a Crime</li>
</ul>
<h3>But why the handcuffs?</h3>
<p>Let me give you a very common situation which might lead an officer to detain someone in handcuffs.</p>
<p>The <b>911 Call Center</b> received a phone call. The call taker hears <i>screaming</i> in the background before the call drops.</p>
<p>Modern Call Centers can track where a call originated from if it is associated with an address.</p>
<p>The officer arrives at the address; let's say it is a <b>residence.</b></p>
<p>While approaching the house, the officer hears <i>screaming</i>.</p>
<p>A woman runs out of the front door with a man <i>chasing her, screaming for her to "get back here".</i></p>
<h3>What do you think is happening? Is this a <i>volatile situation?</i> Is anyone acting in a <i>threatening manner?</i> </h3>
<p>This is a common domestic situation officers find themselves in. They have very little information,
  almost next to no context, and they must make a decision right then and there.</p>
  <h3>What decision would <b>YOU</b> make?</h3>
  <p>During my time as an officer, I would approach this situation as follows:</p>
  <p>Separate the two, but keep both of them within my line of sight.</p>
  <p>Have the two stand or sit in an area <b>I have checked</b> and know is free of weapons.</p>
  <p>That means no kitchen (knives), garages (tools), or couches (weapons under cushions), unless I know the area is free of weapons.</p>
  <p>I proceed to talk to one at a time, while another officer is with the other individual (if possible).</p>
  <h3>But how did it come to pulling out handcuffs?</h3>
  <p>If one of the individuals keeps acting aggressively and will not obey the officer's commands,
    the officer must determine if there is a safety risk.</p>
    <p><b>If the officer believes there is a safety risk, or someone may become violent,</b>
       the officer will detain everyone in handcuffs until he knows the full extent of the situation.</p>
       <p>Once the officer has completed their <i>investigation</i>, he will release everyone from handcuffs <i>UNLESS</i>
       they have determined a crime has been committed.</p>
       <h3>Common situations where you'll be detained in handcuffs.</h3>
       <ul>
         <li>If <i>Drugs</i> are Involved</li>
         <li>If <i>Weapons</i> are Readily <b>Available</b></li>
         <li>If <i>Physical Violence</i> is Being <i>Threatened</i></li>
         <li>If <b>Both Parties</b> have <i>Physical Injuries,</i> but the <i>Aggressor</i> has not been Determined</li>
       </ul>
       <h3>I carry a gun <b>legally</b> in my car. I don't want to be <i>handcuffed</i> for legally carrying a gun!</h3>
       <p>You shouldn't be, and very likely will not be, unless you give the officer a reason to suspect you're <i>a threat to yourself or others.</i></p>
       <p><b>Detaining in handcuffs</b> is a measure to de-escalate a <i>volatile situation</i> before <b>Use of Force</b> is necessary.</p>
       <p>If an officer says he is putting you in handcuffs during his investigation, it is best to comply and not resist.</p>
