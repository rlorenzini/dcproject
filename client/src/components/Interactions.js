      <h1 className="body"><b>Common Interactions</b> with Officers</h1>
<h3>Quick Need-to-Knows</h3>
<p>You <b>MUST</b> provide any officer who asks your <b>FULL NAME, BIRTHDAY, AND ADDRESS</b>.</p>
<p><i>DO NOT LIE TO AN OFFICER.</i> In almost all cases, it is a <i>criminal offense</i>.</p>
<p>A <b>sovereign citizen</b> will say you have a <b>right to travel</b>. This is only <i>HALF TRUE</i>. You have a right to travel <b>between states</b> as a citizen.
You do <i>NOT</i> have a right to <b>operate a vehicle on public roads</b>.</p>
<p>Officers love to play Twenty Questions and use technical words.</p>
<p>Interacting with the police can be <i>intimidating</i>.</p>
<p>Yet an officer is just a person doing a job. They want the same respect and courtesy you'd show anyone else.</p>
<h3>When will I interact with an Officer?</h3>
<p>If you <b>call 911</b>, are <b>inside a business</b> which calls 911, or are <b>witness</b> to a possible <i>crime or accident</i>,
  an officer will ask you questions regarding what you may have seen.</p>
<p>There is no reason to become <i>alarmed</i> when an officer approaches you.</p>
<p>A routine reaction may go as follows:</p>
<ul>
  <li>"My name is <b>Officer Lorenzini</b> and I am with the <b>Cobb County Police Department</b>."</li>
  <li>"I need to ask you a few questions regarding the <b>recent incident</b>."</li>
  <li>"What is your <b>name/address/phone number</b>? May I see your <b>ID</b>?"</li>
</ul>
<h3>Why does an officer need my <b>Driver's License/State ID</b>?</h3>
<p>Officers run names all day long. By using a <b>government issued identification card</b>, not only does it save the officer
<i>time and effort</i>, it allows them to retrieve your <b>information</b> later if needed.</p>
<p>Until an officer can <b>identify you in the system</b>, you will be <i>detained</i>.</p>
<p>Would you rather provide your ID or wait for an officer to find you <b>BY NAME</b>? How many people share your name?</p>
<p>Using an ID also allows <b>other officers</b> listening over the radio to run your information for the officer.</p>
<p>As you can probably see, this helps an officer in many ways.</p>
<p>An officer asking for an ID <b>does not</b> imply you are <i>guilty</i> of anything. It is, in most areas, <b>standard proceedure</b>.</p>
<h3><b>Traffic Stops</b></h3>
<p>Understanding a traffic stop is the first step in understanding your interaction with an officer.</p>
<p>A traffic stop means you have <i>violated a traffic law</i> in some capacity, or the officer has <i>probable cause</i> to stop your vehicle.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Is your tag expired?</li>
  <li>Were you swerving? Clearly, you weren't texting and driving, right?</li>
  <li>Did you run a stop sign or red light?</li>
  <li>Do you know the speed limit?</li>
  <li>Are you in the HOV lane with one person?</li>
</ul>
<p>Any violation of a traffic law gives an officer <b>probable cause</b> to seize your car. This is called a <b>traffic stop</b>.</p>
<p>Don't freak out! They are not keeping your car. It is a <b>temporary seizure</b> until they have concluded the traffic stop.</p>
<h3>What to <b>say and do</b> during a traffic stop.</h3>
<p>The officer will lead the conversation. All you need to do is respond <b>appropriately and politely</b>.</p>
<p>My jurisdiction never trained us to ask, <i>"Do you know why I pulled you over?"</i></p>
<p>We started by identifying ourselves, our department, and then <b>telling you why</b> we pulled you over.</p>
<p>Regardless, answer the officer's questions <b>honestly</b>. It is very easy to get <i>caught in a lie</i>.</p>
<p>Once you lie, the officer will be expecting you to be <b>hiding something</b>, which created a whole new headache for both of you.</p>
<h1><b>Pennsylvania vs. Mimms</b></h1>
<p>If an officer asks or tells you to <b>exit your vehicle</b> during a traffic stop, the <b>Supreme Court</b>,
which is our Federal Government's Court, has determined you <i>MUST</i> exit your vehicle.</p>
<h3>If you have a <b>GUN</b> in your vehicle...</h3>
<p>When you officer tells you to give them your <b>driver's license, registration, and proof of insurance</b>, calmly tell the officer,</p>
<p>"Officer, I have a firearm in my vehicle. It is a &#123;insert firearm type here&#125; and is located &#123;insert location here&#125;."</p>
<h3>If your <b>FIREARM</b> is located near your <b>WALLET</b>, such as in the <b>glove box</b>...</h3>
<p>"Officer, my wallet is also in the glove box, next to my firearm. How would you like me to retrieve it?"</p>
<p><b>Put the ball back in their park!</b></p>
<p>This is huge. This shows you identify a possible risk <i>to the officer</i>, and let them know you're willing to <b>cooperate</b>.</p>
<p>If the officer tells you to move slowly, <b>DO NOT MOVE FASTER THAN YOU'D BE COMFORTABLE WITH.</b></p>
<p>Put yourself in the officer's position. A complete stranger is <i>reaching for a gun</i>. How slow would you want that stranger moving?</p>
<h3>Conversations with Officers</h3>
<p>Do not start a conversation with, "<b>Am I being detained?</b>" This shows a lack of respect for the officer, their authority, and their time.</p>
<p>If you are unsure about a situation, <b>ask an officer politely</b>. "Am I free to leave? Do you need anything more from me?"</p>
<p>Do not argue. If it is over a ticket, take it to traffic court. If it is over a situation, <b>calmly explain it</b>.</p>
<h3>Outside Conversations</h3>
<p><i>AVOID</i> making <b>furtive movements</b>, or movements which can be seen as agressive.</p>
<p>If you told an officer there is a <b>firearm</b> in your glove box, <i>do not</i> dive for your glove box.</p>
<p>If you have a bat in your hand, <i>do not</i> get into a batting position <i>ready to swing</i>.</p>
<p><b>Furtive movements</b> will escalate the situations unnecessarily. <b>Stay calm, communicate your actions, and move slowly.</b></p>
<p>Keep your hands <b>visible</b>. Hands kill; hands that can be see could be holding a <i>weapon</i>.</p>
<h3>Overall...</h3>
<p>Stay calm and just talk.</p>
<p>An officer is a <b>person</b> with an <i>extremely dangerous job</i>. The officer might be uptight, but it's <b>for a reason</b>.</p>
<p>Treat an officer with <b>respect</b>, and they will treat you with <b>respect</b> back.</p>
