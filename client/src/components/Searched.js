<ul>
  <li><b>Pat Down</b>: An officer will check for weapons without doing an invasive search.</li>
  <li><i>Search</i>: Officer is doing a fully invasive search of your person for all items, weapons, etc.</li>
</ul>
<p>When an officer searches a person, they have <b>probable cause</b>. Probable cause is, while taking into account the <b>totality of the circumstances</b>,
a <i>crime</i> was <b>probably</b> commited and <b>YOU probably</b> committed it.</p>
<p>A <b>search</b> is done on people who are <i>under arrest</i>.</p>
<p>Since an officer is <b>NOT</b> the judge and jury, he <i>CANNOT</i> definitively state you are a criminal.</p>
<p>That is why the verbage is <b>PROBABLY</b>, and not <i>DEFINITELY</i>.</p>
<p>An officer's primary job is the <b>determine</b> if there is enough <b>evidence</b> for a trial.</p>
<p>The <b>lawyers</b> hash out the legal details in a courtroom with a <b>judge</b>.</p>
<h3>What if an officer says they're going to do a <b>Pat Down</b>?</h3>
<p>Simply put, <i>let them.</i> If they have no <b>reasonable suspicion</b> to justify a pat down,
   it is <b>better</b> to let the officer do the <b>pat down</b> than to <i>resist</i>.</p>
<p><i>IF</i> the situation is <i>VOLATILE</i>, an officer will do a <b>PAT DOWN</b> for their, and your, <b>SAFETY</b>.</p>
<p>If an officer starts <i>searching</i> inside of your <b>clothing</b>, excluding outwear such as jackets, they are now doing a <b>SEARCH</b>.</p>
<h3>A <b>search</b> means I'm <i>under arrest</i> though!</h3>
<p>Legally, yes, though some officers are <i>zealous</i>, not all officers have the <b>same level of training</b>, and some officers are just <i>bad officers</i>. </p>
<p>I cover this more under <b>Unlawful Actions</b>, but know this: As long as it will not cause <i>permanent physical harm or death</i>, let the officer <b>arrest you</b>.</p>
<p>You'll be able to contact a <b>lawyer</b> later to understand if you have a <b>legitimate case</b> for a wrongful arrest.</p>
