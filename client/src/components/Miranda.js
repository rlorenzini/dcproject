      <h1 className="body"><b>Miranda Rights</b></h1>
<h3>Also known as <b>Miranda Warning</b></h3>
<p>Before an <b>interrogation</b>, which is when an officer <b>specifically asks you questions about a crime</b>,
an officer <i>MUST</i> read you the <b>Miranda Rights</b>.</p>
<p>Miranda Rights must be read literally, and <i>cannot</i> be paraphrased in any way.
This means the officer <i>cannot</i> translate the Miranda Rights in <b>another language</b>.</p>
<p>The full Miranda Rights:</p>
<ul>
  <li>You have the right to remain silent.</li>
  <li>Anything you say can be used against you in court.</li>
  <li>You have a right to talk to a lawyer for advice before we ask you any questions.</li>
  <li>You have the right to have a lawyer with you during questioning.</li>
  <li>If you cannot afford a lawyer, one will be appointed for you before any questioning if you wish.</li>
  <li>If you decide to answer questions now without a lawyer present, you have the right to stop answering at any time.</li>
  <li><b>DO YOU UNDERSTAND THESE RIGHTS? DO YOU WISH TO TALK TO US AT THIS TIME?</b></li>
</ul>
<p>Government agencies provide their officers with <b>Miranda Rights Cards</b>, which may be worded <b>slightly</b> different.</p>
<p>This is the only time you will see <b>any difference</b>. An officer is expected to reach <b>from the card, word by word.</b></p>
<h3>When Does This Matter?</h3>
<p>An interrogation can only be conducted <b>if you have been arrested</b> <i>or if the officer intends to arrest you</i>.</p>
<p>If at the time of the interrogation the officer <i>knew they were going to arrest you</i>, but did <b>not read you</b> the Miranda Rights,
everything you said is not emissible as evidence in court.</p>
<h3>But An Officer Asks Me Questions During a Traffic Stop?</h3>
<p>An investigation is when an officer determines if a crime has been committed. Officers are <b>expected</b> to ask questions at this point.</p>
<p>If an arrest is being made, or if further questioning <b>specific to the relevant crime</b> is to be conducted,
then an officer <i>MUST</i> read you the Miranda Rights.</p>
<p>An officer can conduct an investigation, arrest you, and book you into jail <i>WITHOUT</i> needing to read you the Miranda Rights.</p>
<p>If you feel an officer <b>should have</b> read you the Miranda Rights but <i>did not</i>, contact a lawyer.</p>
<h3>Explaining the Rights</h3>
<p>To put it as simple as possible, you do not have to talk to the police (outside of identifying yourself), anything you say can be used against you in court,
you can get a lawyer at any time, your lawyer can be present any time you wish, and you can stop talking to the officers at any time.</p>
<p><b>IF YOU TELL AN OFFICER YOU DO NOT WISH TO TALK FURTHER WITHOUT A LAWYER</b>,<i> THEY MUST STOP ASKING QUESTIONS IMMEDIATELY</i>.</p>
<p>If they ask to verify you are certain, that is acceptable. If they attempt to coherse or ask further questions, that is <i>illegal</i>.</p>
